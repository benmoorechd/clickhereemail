Support team,

At your earliest convenience please attach out Google Analytics code to the Online Shopper portion of <Client Name> (<Client URL>).

We're currently tracking users on the core website but as Online Shopper is hosted elsewhere, we're losing attribution on potential conversions.

Here is their ID: <GA ID>

Thank you,
